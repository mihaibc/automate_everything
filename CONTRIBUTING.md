## Coding Guidelines

- **Readability**: Write clear and understandable code. Use meaningful variable and function names.
- **Documentation**: Include comments in your code where necessary. Provide a brief explanation at the top of your script describing its purpose.
- **Consistency**: Follow the coding style used in the repository. For Python, this typically means adhering to PEP 8 standards.
- **Modularity**: If possible, structure your scripts so they can be reused or easily adapted to other tasks.
