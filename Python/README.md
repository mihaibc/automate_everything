## How to Use

1. **Navigate to the relevant subdirectory:**
   - Depending on the task you want to automate, go to the corresponding folder within the `Python` directory.

2. **Install dependencies (if any):**
   - Some scripts may require external Python packages. If a `requirements.txt` file is present, install the dependencies using:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the script:**
   - Execute the script from the command line:
     ```bash
     python script_name.py
     ```
   - Replace `script_name.py` with the actual name of the script you want to run.

4. **Modify the script if necessary:**
   - Many scripts are designed to be configurable. Open the script in a text editor and modify any parameters or settings as needed before running.
